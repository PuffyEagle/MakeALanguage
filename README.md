# Welcome to MakeALanguage!
This is my attempt to create a language in C++ using Faical Tchirou and Ruslan Spivak's tutorials.<br>
## How to run this code:
Head over to the "Actions" tab at the top of the repo.    
Make sure that your branch is set to "master" for the latest release build. In other words, you should enter this into the searchbar:<br>
`workflow:C/C++ branch:master`<br>
Click on the link at the top.<br>
In the Artifacts section, click on "spark". You may get a warning, but I assure you, this code has no viruses. Press the arrow on the right and press "Keep". Open the zip file - you should see a .exe file called "spark". Drag this into the folder where you want your spark projects to be.<br>
### Running: Windows
Navigate to your project folder and do Shift+Right-click. Press "Open PowerShell window here." Now run ./spark <your file>. Voila!
