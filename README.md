# Welcome to MakeALanguage!
This is my attempt to create a language in C++ using Faical Tchirou and Ruslan Spivak's tutorials.<br>
## How to run this code:
Click on [this link](https://repl.it/@DanielZhu5/MakeALanguage#test.txt).<br>
This is the input file. Once you have finished editing its content, click run. The output will be the following:<br>
1. Tokens recognized by the lexer.     
2. Blocks recognized by the parser.     
3. Variables recognized by the interpreter.    
## Valid syntax   
So far, this code only supports the following:    
1. The basic four arithmetic operators    
2. Blocks (defined with { and })
3. Defining and using variables
4. Integer and float division (// and / respectively)
Check out the [default input file](https://github.com/dantheking-crypto/MakeALanguage/blob/master/test.txt) for more details.
